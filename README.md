# CS3500
Final project submissions for Northeastern's CS3500, Object-Oriented Design.

Over the course, we worked on two primary projects- one to create a Marble Solitaire game and one to create an image processor. 
Each assignment required extending functionality, and implementing good design principles along the way.
